# Remote Workers Predicative Analysis
This research delves into the prediction of factors impacting job satisfaction among remote workers in the UK by: 

- Assessing the accuracy of two job satisfaction management theories in a new dataset: Hackman and Oldham's (1976) Job Characteristic Model (JCM) and Herzberg's (1976) Two-Factor Theory.
- Investigating the mediating role of motivation in the relationship between job satisfaction and key elements such as autonomy, feedback, and task significance. 
- Scrutinising the influence of intrinsic factors (advancement, the nature of the work itself, growth opportunities, recognition, and career advancement) and extrinsic factors (interpersonal relationships, salary, supervision, working conditions, and job security) on job satisfaction. 

A robust sample size of over 10,000 remote workers in the United Kingdom was examined using a secondary dataset obtained from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey in 2015. The findings were subjected to scrutiny through three distinct statistical methods and advanced machine learning tools: Linear Mediation Model, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

# Research Aim
To conduct a predictive analysis on the factors that influence the job satisfaction of remote worker in the UK and to explore the mediating role of motivation in this context.

# Research Objectives
- To assess and test the accuracy and assumptions of the proposed factors of the JCM theory in a unique dataset, examining their correlation with remote workers in the UK.
- Based on literature, propose, and identify the mediating role of motivation between the relationship of JCM Theory and job satisfaction.
- To identify additional factors that influence job satisfaction by leveraging Herzberg's (1966) Dual-Factor Theory (instrinsic and extrinsic factors).
- Using advanced machine learning tools LASSO and OLS multiple linear regression, to conduct a predictive analysis on the factors influencing job satisfaction, drawing on variables derived from both the JCM and Herzberg's Dual-Factor theories.

# Result
The findings supports the statistical assumptions of Hackman and Oldham (1976). Herzberg (1976) theory, on the other hand, produced an inconsistent result as assumptions of 
intrinsic factors held true while untrue for extrinsic factors. Furthermore, the research indicated that remote workers are primarily influenced by psychological and motivational factors. 
The top three factors strongly associated with job satisfaction were identified as motivation, achievement, and advancement, while job security and supervision exhibited significant relevance to job dissatisfaction.

Hypothesis 1: Autonomy has positive relationship with motivation


Hypothesis 2: Autonomy has positive relationship with JS


Hypothesis 3: Feedback has a positive relationship with motivation


Hypothesis 4: Feedback has a positive relationship with JS 


Hypothesis 5: Task significance has a positive relationship with motivation


Hypothesis 6: Task significance has a positive relationship with JS 


Hypothesis 7: Motivation has a positive relationship with JS
